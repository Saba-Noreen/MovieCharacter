This project is a Machine Learning app built using Streamlit that predicts the gender of a movie character based on:

Credit position (order of appearance in movie credits)

Character name

Movie title

It combines EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), ML modeling, and a real-time prediction interface in one interactive app.
